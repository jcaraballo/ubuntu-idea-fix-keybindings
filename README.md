Ubuntu has its own opinions on the key bindings, which often tries to re-assert. It's wrong.

Works for me in Ubuntu 15.10

If you can't be bothered to clone it, you can run whatever is in master with

        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaraballo/ubuntu-idea-fix-keybindings/master/fix-shortcuts.bash | bash
